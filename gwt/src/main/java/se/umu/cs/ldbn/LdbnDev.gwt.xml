      Enable experimental WindowLogger, which logs messages to a separate
      popup window. There are currently a couple of restrictions:
        1. When Firefox is configured to open new Windows as new tabs,
           WindowLogger does not work
        2. In hosted mode, the windows are not automatically closed,
           although you can easily close them manually in the usual way
      -->
    <set-property name="log_WindowLogger" value="DISABLED"/>

    <!--
    You probably will want to disable the default `DivLogger` as well:
    -->
    <set-property name="log_DivLogger" value="ENABLED"/>

    <!--
      The default log level is `OFF`. In development you'll usually want
      to switch to `DEBUG` level logging.
